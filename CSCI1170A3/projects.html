                            <p>
                                I made this very early on in my programming career. It was made using the 3D Unity Game engine. There are 6 different maps,
                                based on real pacman maps, such as the origin pacman map, the prototype, and popular pacman clones such mrs pacman. It is first person
                                and 3D with a minimap so you don't run into ghosts while turning corners. Once all pellets have been collected you get loaded into
                                another random map. You have 5 lives and try to get a highscore. There is a saving system for stats and the highscore.

                            <p>
                                This is a text editor made using C++ and OpenGL. The text is rendered using a texture (which is why it is pixelated). The idea
                                was to make a text editor that did not use the mouse, that also serves the purpose of being a journal/notes app. The way you
                                navigate the app is using a command line style interface. The very first line is a command line where you input a command and the
                                app with respond. There will also be a few shortcuts that you can use.

                                A simple app I made to learn about machine learning. It uses the MNist handwritten digit dataset to train a simple
                                neural network that can tell what digit you wrote with decent accuracy. It has a canvas where you can draw, and it will tell you
                                what number it thinks it is.

                            <p>
                                The idea for the game is based on the theme of roots. You are a kid who steals the magical root from the forest, which makes the
                                forest mad. This them prompts evil ghosts and bushes to attack you. You then run around and try to kill as many enemies as possible.
                                The game was made in a weekend with a team of 4 beginners using the Unity Game engine. It was pretty fun.
